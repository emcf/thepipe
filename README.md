### Feed PDFs, word docs, slides, web pages and more into Vision-LLMs with one line of code ⚡

The Pipe is a multimodal-first tool for feeding files and web pages into vision-language models such as GPT-4V. It is best for LLM and RAG applications that require a deep understanding of tricky data sources. The Pipe is available as a hosted API at [thepi.pe](https://thepi.pe), or it can be set up locally.

## Features 🌟

- Extracts text and visuals from files or web pages 📚
- Outputs chunks optimized for multimodal LLMs 🖼️
- Interpret complex PDFs, web pages, slides, CSVs, and more 🧠
- Auto-compress prompts exceeding your chosen token limit 📦
- Works even with missing file extensions, in-memory data streams 💾
- Works with codebases, git repos, and custom integrations 🌐
- Multi-threaded ⚡️

## Getting Started  🚀

The Pipe handles a wide array of complex filetypes, and thus has many dependencies that must be installed separately. It also requires a strong machine for good response times. For this reason, we host it as an API that works out-of-the-box. 

First, install The Pipe. 
```
pip install thepipe_api
```

The Pipe is available as a hosted API, or it can be set up locally. An API key is recommended for out-of-the-box functionality (alternatively, see the local installation section). Ensure the `THEPIPE_API_KEY` environment variable is set. Don't have a key yet? [Get one here](https://thepi.pe).

Now you can extract comprehensive text and visuals from any file:
```python
from thepipe_api import thepipe
messages = thepipe.extract("example.pdf")
```
Or any website:
```python
messages = thepipe.extract("https://example.com")
```
Then feed it into GPT-4-Vision:
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages = messages,
)
```

You can also use The Pipe from the command line. Here's how to recursively extract from a directory, matching only files containing a substring (in this example, typescript files) and ignore files containing other substrings (in this example, anything in the "tests" folder):
```bash
thepipe path/to/folder --match tsx --ignore tests
```

## How it works 🛠️

The input source is either a file path, a URL, or a directory. The pipe will extract information from the source and process it for downstream use with [language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), [vision transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer), or [vision-language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00685). The output from the pipe is a sensible list of multimodal messages representing chunks of the extracted information, carefully crafted to fit within context windows for any models from [gemma-7b](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b) to [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4). The messages returned should look like this:
```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "..."
      },
      {
        "type": "image_url",
        "image_url": {
          "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
If you want to feed these messages directly into the model, it is important to be mindful of the token limit.
OpenAI does not allow too many images in the prompt (see discussion [here](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-4-vision-maximum-amount-of-images/573110/6)), so long files should be extracted with `text_only=True` to avoid this issue. 

The text and images from these messages may also be prepared for a vector database with `thepipe.core.create_chunks_from_messages` or for downstream use with RAG frameworks. [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) can be used to easily integrate The Pipe with any LLM provider. 

It uses a variety of heuristics for optimal performance with vision-language models, including AI filetype detection with [filetype detection](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/02/magika-ai-powered-fast-and-efficient-file-type-identification.html), opt-in AI [table, equation, and figure extraction](https://thepi.pe/pricing), efficient [token compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12968), automatic [image encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64), [reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06839) for [lost-in-the-middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) effects, and more, all pre-built to work out-of-the-box.


## Local Installation 🛠️

The Pipe handles a wide array of complex filetypes, and thus requires installation of many different packages to function. It also requires a very capable machine for good response times. For this reason, we host it as an API that works out-of-the-box. To use The Pipe locally for free instead, you will need [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/), [pytesseract](https://github.com/h/pytesseract), and the local python requirements, which differ from the more lightweight API requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emcf/thepipe
pip install -r requirements_local.txt
```

Tip for windows users: Install the python-libmagic binaries with `pip install python-magic-bin`. Ensure the `tesseract-ocr` binaries and the `ctags` binaries are in your PATH.

Now you can use The Pipe with Python:
```bash
from thepipe_api import thepipe
chunks = thepipe.extract("example.pdf", local=True)
```

or from the command line:
```bash
thepipe path/to/folder --local
```

Arguments are:
- `source` (required): can be a file path, a URL, or a directory path.
- `local` (optional): Use the local version of The Pipe instead of the hosted API.
- `match` (optional): Substring to match files in the directory. Regex is not yet supported.
- `ignore` (optional): Substring to ignore files in the directory. Regex is not yet supported.
- `limit` (optional): The token limit for the output prompt, defaults to 100K. Prompts exceeding the limit will be compressed. This may not work as expected with the API, as it is in active development.
- `ai_extraction` (optional): Extract tables, figures, and math from PDFs using our extractor. Incurs extra costs.
- `text_only` (optional): Do not extract images from documents or websites. Additionally, image files will be represented with OCR instead of as images.
