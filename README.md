### Extract markdown and visuals from PDFs URLs, slides, videos, and more, ready for multimodal LLMs. ‚ö°

thepi.pe is an API that can scrape multimodal data via `thepipe.scrape` or extract structured data via `thepipe.extract` from a wide range of sources. It is built to interface with vision-language models such as GPT-4o, and works out-of-the-box with any LLM or vector database. It can be used right away with a [hosted cloud](https://thepi.pe), or it can be run locally.

## Features üåü

- Extract markdown, tables, and images from any document or webpage
- Extract complex structured data from any document or webpage
- Works out-of-the-box with LLMs, vector databases, and RAG frameworks
- AI-native filetype detection, layout analysis, and structured data extraction
- Multimodal scraping for video, audio, and image sources

## Get started in 5 minutes  üöÄ

thepi.pe can read a wide range of filetypes and web sources, so it requires a few dependencies. It also requires vision-language model inference for AI extraction features. For these reasons, we host an API that works out-of-the-box. For more detailed setup instructions, view the [docs](https://thepi.pe/docs-platform).

```bash
pip install thepipe-api
```

### Hosted API (Python)

You can get an API key by signing up for a free account at [thepi.pe](https://thepi.pe). The, simply set the `THEPIPE_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.

```python
from thepipe.scraper import scrape_file
from thepipe.core import chunks_to_messages
from openai import OpenAI

# scrape clean markdown
chunks = scrape_file(filepath="paper.pdf", ai_extraction=False)

# call LLM with scraped chunks
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=chunks_to_messages(chunks),
)
```

### Local Installation (Python)

For a local installation, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install thepipe-api[local]
```

You must have a local LLM server setup and running for AI extraction features. You can use any local LLM server that follows OpenAI format (such as [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)). Next, set the `LLM_SERVER_BASE_URL` environment variable to your LLM server's endpoint URL and set `LLM_SERVER_API_KEY` to the API key for your LLM of choice. the `DEFAULT_AI_MODEL` environment variable can be set to the model name of your LLM. For example, you may use `openai/gpt-4o-mini` if using OpenRouter or `gpt-4o-mini` if using OpenAI. 

For full functionality with media-rich sources, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git ffmpeg tesseract-ocr
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

When using thepi.pe, be sure to append `local=True` to your function calls:

```python
chunks = scrape_url(url="https://example.com", local=True)
```

You can also use thepi.pe from the command line:
```bash
thepipe path/to/folder --include_regex .*\.tsx --local
```

## How it works üõ†Ô∏è

thepi.pe uses computer vision models and heuristics to extract clean content from the source and process it for downstream use with [language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), or [vision transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer). The output from thepi.pe is a list of chunks containing all content within the source document. These chunks can easily be converted to a prompt format that is compatible with any LLM or multimodal model with `thepipe.core.chunks_to_messages`, which gives the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "..."
      },
      {
        "type": "image_url",
        "image_url": {
          "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

You can feed these messages directly into the model, or alternatively you can use `chunker.chunk_by_document`, `chunker.chunk_by_page`, `chunker.chunk_by_section`, `chunker.chunk_semantic` to chunk these messages for a vector database such as ChromaDB or a RAG framework. A chunk can be converted to LlamaIndex Document/ImageDocument with `.to_llamaindex`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **It is important to be mindful of your model's token limit.**
GPT-4o does not work with too many images in the prompt (see discussion [here](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-4-vision-maximum-amount-of-images/573110/6)). To remedy this issue, either use an LLM with a larger context window, extract larger documents with `text_only=True`, or embed the chunks into vector database.
